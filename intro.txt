Instructions:

Phase I: For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces.
Instructors/TAs: Once time is up have students share their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list that you can slack them.

Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.

Create a basic server using Express.JS

Create a few array variables that will hold the data

Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server





WE will create seperate HTML files for the home page, a page to make a reservation, and a page to view reservation.

we need to create a database that holds atleast 2 tables one for reservations and one for the waiting list.

The reservation table can only hold 5 rows

inside of the rows will hold the name, phone number, email, and the unique ID for tha person.

any reservation will be pushed into the waiting list instead. and held there until a spot becomes availabe inside the reservation list.

create variables for reservations and for wating list.

make the reservations table only go up to 5

if statement that pushes reservations into the waiting list array when the reservations array reaches 5

create functions that will update the html template with infromation from the server when the forms are complete and the appropriate button is pressed

create buttons that will navigate the html pages

using jQuery we will contact the server and use the infromation inside of it to display it on the appropriate HTML pages.
